# Special Fields

Rapyer provides special field annotations that modify how your models interact with Redis. These fields give you additional control over model behavior, though they should be used carefully and only when necessary.

## Key Field

The `Key` field annotation allows you to specify a custom field to act as the primary key instead of Rapyer's automatically generated primary key. When you use a `Key` field, it overrides the value of the model's `pk` property. This is useful when you have meaningful identifiers like user IDs, email addresses, or timestamps that should serve as unique identifiers.

**⚠️ Warning**: Using custom key fields is usually not recommended. The automatic primary key generation is optimized for Redis operations and handles uniqueness automatically. Only use custom keys when you have a specific business requirement for meaningful identifiers.

### Basic Usage

```python
from rapyer import AtomicRedisModel
from rapyer.fields import Key

class User(AtomicRedisModel):
    user_id: Key(str)  # This field will be used as the primary key
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int = 25
```

### Alternative Syntax with Annotated

```python
from typing import Annotated
from datetime import datetime
from rapyer import AtomicRedisModel
from rapyer.fields import Key

class Event(AtomicRedisModel):
    created_at: Annotated[datetime, Key()]  # datetime as primary key
    event_name: str
    description: str
    duration_minutes: int = 60
```

### Examples

#### User with Email as Key

```python
from rapyer.fields import Key

class User(AtomicRedisModel):
    email: Key(str)  # Email serves as the unique identifier
    name: str
    age: int
    preferences: dict = {}

# Usage
user = User(email="alice@example.com", name="Alice", age=30)
await user.asave()  # Stored with email as the Redis key
```

#### Log Entry with Timestamp Key

```python
from datetime import datetime
from rapyer.fields import Key

class LogEntry(AtomicRedisModel):
    timestamp: Key(datetime)
    level: str
    message: str
    source: str

# Usage
log = LogEntry(
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    level="INFO",
    message="Application started",
    source="main.py"
)
await log.asave()  # Stored with timestamp as the Redis key
```

#### Product with SKU Key

```python
from rapyer.fields import Key

class Product(AtomicRedisModel):
    sku: Key(str)  # Product SKU as primary key
    name: str
    price: float
    category: str

# Usage
product = Product(
    sku="LAPTOP-2024-001",
    name="Gaming Laptop",
    price=1299.99,
    category="Electronics"
)
await product.asave()
```

## Important Considerations

### Key Uniqueness

Ensure your custom key field values are guaranteed to be unique across all instances:

```python
# ✅ Good: Emails are naturally unique
class User(AtomicRedisModel):
    email: Key(str)  # Safe choice
    name: str

# ⚠️ Risky: Names might not be unique
class User(AtomicRedisModel):
    name: Key(str)    # Could cause conflicts!
    email: str
```

### Immutability

Custom key field values should never change after the model is saved. Changing the key value can lead to unexpected behavior:

```python
user = User(email="john@example.com", name="John")
await user.asave()

# ❌ Avoid changing the key field value
user.email = "john.doe@example.com"  # This changes the primary key!
await user.asave()  # This might create a new record instead of updating
```

### Performance Impact

- Custom keys have the same performance as auto-generated keys
- The key field is used directly in Redis operations
- No additional overhead is introduced by using custom keys

### Migration Considerations

If you need to add a custom key to an existing model:

1. **Data Migration**: Existing records will continue using auto-generated keys
2. **Backward Compatibility**: New records will use the custom key field
3. **Gradual Migration**: Consider migrating data in batches if needed

```python
# Before: Using auto-generated keys
class User(AtomicRedisModel):
    name: str
    email: str

# After: Adding custom key (existing records keep auto-generated keys)
class User(AtomicRedisModel):
    email: Key(str)  # New records will use email as key
    name: str
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Stable Values**: Use fields that won't change over the model's lifetime
2. **Ensure Uniqueness**: Verify that key field values are guaranteed to be unique
3. **Document Intent**: Clearly document why a custom key is necessary
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your application handles key-based operations correctly
5. **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate whether the automatic primary key generation meets your needs
6. **Use Sparingly**: Only implement custom keys when there's a clear business requirement

## When NOT to Use Custom Keys

- **Auto-incrementing IDs**: Redis doesn't natively support auto-increment
- **Non-unique values**: Any field that might have duplicate values
- **Frequently changing values**: Fields that might need updates
- **Complex composite keys**: Redis works best with simple string keys
- **Default use cases**: When the automatic primary key generation works fine
